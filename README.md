# Print-Screen-Fest-16-Pop-Up-Workshop-for-Women

This is the workshop I taught at the Pop Up School for Women, a series of workshops that introduced women from various ages, skill sets and experiences to ways in which technology could be used with their area of expertise.

### ** VERY IMPORTANT: Use the FLORA for this workshop. https://www.adafruit.com/product/659 It was a HUGE mistake to use the Trinket, because it required a very LONG and CONFUSING process of downloading and installing a number of libraries. So unless you have time to prepare the computers with the proper libraries and software, I would use the FLORA because it is easier to set up. It still requires set up, but it is a less complicated process. ** 

4 hour workshop: 30 participants

####Workshop Description: 
Make simple glove controllers with lights to connect to your favorite web games. 
We will explore introductory electronics, physical computing, conductive fabrics and materials, code and interaction. 
Bring or wear clothes that you can make into controllers! 

####Learning goals: 
- Concept of making and breaking a circuit. 
- Introduction to conductive fabrics and materials. 
- Microcontroller, the Trinket will be introduced. 
- Code & interaction will be explored. 
- How to keep learning when workshop is over.
